# questions about twilio:

    what is this job, exactly?
    which area? -- seems like a lot of different parts to the api.
    is twilio interested in creating a one stop replacement for having a web sockets server?
    if I understand :
        flex - enterprise, wix-like but extendable -- is it fully extendable?  should I be using it?
        programmable voice / video / chat - are these being deprectated?
        Conversations?
        Sync - is this intended to be used for something like users, or as a web sockets replacement?
            -- sync with serverless tutorials??  (all seem to be iot)
        twilio serverless ... how does twilio want us to use this?
