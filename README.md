# group channel with redux n stuff.

   I haven't quite been able to figure out the right syntax for the dial.conference().  I'll revisit when I have time, because finding a simple and straightforward serverless solution to this problem really interests me.

   It's a pretty straightforward react/redux app (material UI styles) with Twilio middleware integration, I think it has potential.
